# Hi! I'm Nicolas Marinelli, a Full Stack Web Developer

## About Me

I started studying programming during the COVID-19 pandemic, after a life long interest in the area. I started with Python, from there I learned the basic web technologies (HTML, CSS and Javascript).
I studied 2 years as a self-learner, in that time I learned React, Redux, Node, Express and Mongo. In 2022 I started the SoyHenry's Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp, there not only I got the chance to practice and develop further my tech skills (by learning SQL, PostgreSQL and Sequelize), but also I met some of the most talented, friendly and faithful colleagues I ever had.

Programming is my passion, and I wish to keep learning it more and more each day!

#### Project Description
Davo Shoes is a E-commerce for selling shoes. You can search by name, filter by brands and categories, add products to your cart and buy them through Mercado Pago (payment gateway). You can Sign Up/In through Auth0 using email and password or with your Google account.

#### My Role
I was in charge of the initial boilerplate of the project, the repository creation as well as its maintenance (PR, Code Reviews, etc...). After that I helped with the creation of the DB models, API endpoints, I developed the authentication/authorization using Auth0, products reviews and user management
